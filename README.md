# SIMPLE UNIX SHELL

## INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN
 * cmd "parameters" ... "parameters" 
 * The spaces between parameters are required where it is splitting on space
 * cd works as normal in most cases to navigate to the "Home" directory only type "~"
 * Typing "cd" alone is not currently handled and will cause a crash. I may fix it before the assignment is due. If I do i'll update this readme.
 * ptime will always print the last commands runtime
 * have fun messing with it

## GRADER NOTE: EXTRA CREDIT IMPLEMENTED
 * pwd
 * cd
